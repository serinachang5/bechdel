# Automating the Bechdel Test
Developing a classifier to automatically predict whether a movie passes the Bechdel Test.

## The Bechdel Test
A movie passes the Bechdel Test if (1) it has at least two women in it, (2) who talk to each other, (3) about something besides a man. The test was popularized by Allison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For (1985). Of the 7656 movies added on https://bechdeltest.com, 4427 (57.8%) pass all three tests, 766 (10.0%) pass two tests, 1674 (21.9%) pass one test and 789 (10.3%) pass no tests at all.

## Screenplays
We are using screenplays from Agarwal et al. (2015) and Gorinski and Lapata (2015). Combined, we have 727 screenplays that have Bechdel ratings from bechdeltest.com. 349 (48.0%) pass all three tests, 103 (14.2%) pass two tests, 222 (30.5%) pass one test, and 53 (7.3%) pass no tests.
